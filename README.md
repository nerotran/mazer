# mazer
requires: pygame

A mini puzzle game where the player solves through progressively harder mazes. I made the game in python using pygame for a school project.

features:\
_5 different levels of mazes and can easily. The program is coded with extensibility in mind. As such, anyone can easily add new levels or modify the existing ones.\
_The mazes are stored in a list before being constructed (rendered) using the pygame sprite renderer.\
_The different graphical objects that need rendering are stored well-structured classes.\
_I got an A+ for the project.
